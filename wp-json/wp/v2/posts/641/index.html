Women never made such a move, to such a degree, in any large human society in the past. It significantly altered the structure of ordinary life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">But women in the late 20th century didn\u2019t just move into the workforce. They moved into its upper ranks, to professions that strongly influence societal culture and policy. They became journalists, public relations specialists, lawyers, academics, novelists, publishers, filmmakers, TV producers, and politicians, all to an unprecedented extent. In some of these culture-making professions, by the 1990s and early 2000s, they had achieved parity or even dominance (e.g., writers, authors, and public relations specialists) with respect to men. Even where they fell short of full parity, they appeared to acquire considerable \u201cveto\u201d power over content. A 2017 report by the Women\u2019s Media Center noted evidence that at the vast majority of media companies, at least one woman is among the top three editors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Women Think Differently About Cultural and Political Matters<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Women\u2019s ascension to power in culture- and policy-making professions has been followed by extensive cultural and political changes. Why? Because women, on average, think differently than men do about cultural and political issues. This should not be surprising: The bodies and minds of women and men were shaped long ago by biological and cultural evolution for their distinct traditional roles in life. Women\u2019s distinct roles obviously have required certain psychological traits or tendencies that are different from male traits. I think most of us would agree that these innately feminine traits include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>A greater emotional sensitivity and capacity for empathy\/compassion\/nurturing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>A greater fearfulness and aversion to risks (concerning dangers to themselves and others), including an extra sensitivity to the risks of toxic and other environmental threats (reflected in hormone-driven pregnancy behaviors such as food\/odor aversions and compulsive \u201cnesting\u201d).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>A greater affinity for people and relationships, and lesser affinity for constructed, systemized, and abstract things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>A greater tendency to align emotionally when in a group, especially a group of other women\u2014a tendency that implies a superior ability (individually and collectively) to transmit emotions and other social contagions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>A reduced affinity for competition and capacity for resistance to aggressors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Greater affinity for themes of suffering and victimhood, with correspondingly less interest in triumphant \u201cmale\u201d themes of exploration and conquest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Probably most of these traits are interrelated. In any case, when one considers these broad aspects of \u201cinnate femininity,\u201d it isn\u2019t hard to see that the very sudden extension of their dominance\u2014from women\u2019s traditional domestic domain to all areas of public life\u2014would help account for the dramatic social changes of the past half-century or so.<\/p>\n<p>It also isn\u2019t hard to see that women tend to support these social changes more than men do\u2014although it&#8217;s important to understand that by altering the culture, women have influenced not only their own but also <em>men\u2019s<\/em> thinking and behavior.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social changes likely to have been driven by the ascendancy of female traits<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Much more generous welfare programs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Extensions of the concept of welfare to include more types of intervention (e.g., affirmative action) and more groups needing intervention (\u201ctraditionally marginalized groups\u201d).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Excessively honoring (e.g., with pronoun declaration rituals) anyone with a claim to victimhood or some other \u201cspecial identity\u201d status.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Very strong social reactions to media portrayals of racial injustice\/inequity, e.g., the near-hysterias following the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO and George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-225\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/bethesdaawokening-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/bethesdaawokening-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/bethesdaawokening-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/bethesdaawokening-1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Inflations of the traditional definitions of \u201charm,\u201d \u201coffense,\u201d \u201ctrauma,\u201d \u201cviolence,\u201d \u201caggression,\u201d etc., as reflected in new terms such as \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d and \u201ctriggers.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>An astounding belief (from men\u2019s perspective) in slight or even imaginary emotional upsets as sources of real harm in the world.

I suspect it more closely represents the attitudes of the single, childless activists who have been most energetic in pushing these social changes. For them, perhaps, society and its \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d from African-Americans to Rio Grande-crossing illegal immigrants, are substitutes for the children they don\u2019t have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Feminization is Problematic<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One sufficient and conservative reason for doubting that cultural feminization is a good thing is simply that it entails the abrupt replacement of a large set of civilizational traits that were embedded in Western people, culturally and probably biologically, over thousands of years. Not every Western trait is essential to the West\u2019s survival or is even still adaptive in the modern world. But discarding these traits at the whim of female activists seems a bit like deleting genes willy-nilly from the human genome. Could you do that without bad consequences? Yes, conceivably&#8212;but it&#8217;s far more likely to end in disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Another good reason to oppose or limit cultural feminization is that, while men traditionally led societies and thus would have been expected to evolve attitudes and behaviors appropriate for that role, women traditionally were confined to other, more private roles, centering on maternity. In other words, why should we suppose that being a mother, or being shaped by evolution for motherhood, is a better preparation for public life than . . . serving in public life, as men have done for ages?<\/p>\n<p>There are further reasons that have to do with specific effects of feminization. For example, feminization appears to have brought a new cultural and political emphasis on short-term, feelgood consequences, with less emphasis on\u2014I would say a blindness to\u2014long-term consequences. It should be obvious that this is unsustainable and must end badly.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, females&#8217; lesser affinity, even hostility, for due process of law, free debate, unfettered scientific inquiry, and related aspects of Western, small-l liberalism, seems likely to render the West relatively static, sclerotic, and poor if allowed to run to its logical conclusion.<\/p>\n<p>Then, of course, there is the apparent female (relative to male) embrace of mass immigration to the West from the Third World, which I think has the potential to dissolve Western societies faster than any other factor.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-165\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/merkel-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/merkel-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/merkel-1-300x211.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s worth mentioning too, though it&#8217;s more speculative, that the apparent decades-long slide in testosterone levels in men might be an effect of cultural feminization. Testosterone levels in men (and women) are known to be regulated by social cues, such as winning or losing competitions, and so <a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.github.io\/testosterone-civilization-and-social-cues\/\">it would make sense<\/a> that cultural messaging condemning and suppressing traditional masculinity would have a T-lowering effect. Lower T means lower fertility, which below a certain threshold\u2014one that Legacy Americans sank beneath long ago\u2014leads ultimately to the extinction of the population.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, there is the sense of <em>taboo<\/em> that enshrouds the idea of cultural feminization, in general but especially when it is framed negatively. The high-profile MSM types (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-09-19\/woke-movement-is-global-and-america-should-be-mostly-proud\">Cowen<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/01\/12\/opinion\/gender-gap-politics.html\">Edsall<\/a>) who have touched the subject (only in the last year or so, as far as I know) have been approving or very mild in their concerns. Also, for more than a decade now, most of the short essays I\u2019ve tried to get published on this subject, including in some pretty right wing publications, have been rejected. In every case, a female editor had veto power, and I think her male colleagues also feared the hostile ululations that would ensue if they published my unvarnished take. Anyhow, an old quote (often attributed to Voltaire) seems apt here: \u201cIf you want to know who rules over you, look at whom you\u2019re not allowed to criticize.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Further reading<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.github.io\/the-great-feminization\/\">The Great Feminization<\/a>&#8221; (2019)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.github.io\/the-day-the-logic-died\/\">The Day the Logic Died<\/a>&#8221; (2019)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.github.io\/cultural-feminization-a-bibliography\/\">Cultural Feminization: a Bibliography<\/a>&#8221; (2021)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09Z7MWJ7R\"><em>The Great Feminization: Women as Drivers of Modern Social Change<\/em><\/a> (2022)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *<\/p>\n<p><em>Author\u2019s note:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I\u2019d appreciate it, reader, if you would link to my essays on cultural feminization (or otherwise cite them) wherever you see this topic being discussed.

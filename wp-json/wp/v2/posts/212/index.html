But they have another adversary that is often overlooked: <em>black<\/em> American nationalism.<\/p>\n<p>Black American nationalism is very easy to overlook, here in the third decade of the new millennium. Although it has had its day in the sun\u2014even Lincoln was in favor of it, once upon a time\u2014its best-known proponent since the Civil Rights Era, Malcolm X, died 56 years ago, at the hands of rival black nationalists, and the movement seems to have gone only downhill since. Already by the mid 1970s Richard Pryor was mocking the \u201cBack to Africa Movement\u201d in his stand-up routines. Black American nationalism also has been tainted (or so one is supposed to think) by the moral support it has occasionally received from overtly white supremacist organizations. In any case, although there must still be millions of black Americans of the nationalist persuasion out there, their movement has by now been relegated to the fringes\u2014the black nationalists who make the news these days seem mostly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcdfw.com\/news\/local\/dallas-shooting-suspect-was-leader-in-black-nationalist-group\/19317\/\">violent, deranged<\/a> and disorganized.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, black American activism that is <em>not<\/em> nationalist seems to have been doing pretty well lately, judging by the recent wildfire contagions of enthusiasm for BLM, the 1619 Project, the George Floyd hagiology, and Critical Race Theory. Last year, leading Democrats actually donned kente cloth stoles and bent a knee on the US Capitol\u2019s marble floor during the announcement of police reform legislation, as if genuflecting to a Justifiably Angry Black God.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-214 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kente.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kente.jpg 700w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kente-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Non-nationalist black activists also seem to have been doing pretty well for themselves personally.

He famously called Martin Luther King Jr. a chump and a stooge of white liberals for promoting the idea of peaceful integration within white America\u2014an idea that to him was an empty promise, aimed as always at perpetuating white control of blacks.<\/p>\n<p>I think he was basically right about that. And if contemporary America\u2019s leftist elites have banished black nationalists to the fringes, and have instead anointed a bunch of racial-equity grifters as the approved \u201cleaders\u201d of black America, then surely black nationalism is something that Legacy Americans should support as energetically as they can.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not just being enemy-of-my-enemy tribalistic here. I\u2019m trying to be coldly logical. The leftist elites of the US, which is to say the leaders of the Democratic Party and their allies and henchwomen in academia, media, entertainment, big business, etc., <em>need<\/em> to keep American blacks in the country and on their side for the most basic electoral reasons. They cannot abide a black separatism that would lead to a new, black nationalist political party or\u2014the elites\u2019 ultimate nightmare\u2014a substantial black exodus from the US to a new homeland, even an internal one. Obviously, such an exodus would, among its many consequences, fatally weaken those leftist elites, in part by removing most of the radioactive core that powers their racial-factionalist ideology.<\/p>\n<p>There is also a strong moral argument here. African-Americans of today are descendants of West Africans who were brought to the New World against their will. Theirs is a population that was literally enslaved for a long time, and then was oppressed for a long time after that. Even as their oppression has eased it has become clear that they are, for the most part, trapped in a world not of their making. In other words, for all this time they have been denied the basic rights of ethnic nationhood and self-determination that most peoples around the world have traditionally enjoyed. The fact that European-derived whites, with their hyperverbal brains and their sentimental, empire-adapted ideology, have overwritten ancient wisdom about the primacy of ethnic nationhood and self-determination, and no longer consider it important, is\u2014American blacks might say, with some heat\u2014not their problem.<\/p>\n<p>It <em>shouldn\u2019t<\/em> be their problem, anyway. And yet it is. And it\u2019s not just their problem, is it? This idea that nations should be substantially multi-racial\/ethnic (\u201cmulticultural\u201d), bound merely by civic nationalism, economic opportunism, and kumbayah songs, is really the ur-problem, the most deeply planted seed of destruction, in the United States and most other Western countries. This idea seems essentially Christian in origin, but was also elaborated in response to the circumstances of the modern West, including colonialism and the globalization of trade and labor. In the US, it was shaped <em>inter alia<\/em> by the issues surrounding the Civil War, and was used, e.g., to justify turning African slaves into Union soldiers and then Republican voters in the Reconstruction South.<\/p>\n<p>Despite multiculturalism&#8217;s clash with traditional ways of organizing societies, and its century and a half of failure in the US, it persists\u2014persists even as racial\/ethnic factionalism ravages the country, burns its cities, corrupts its democracy, and ruins its quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Even worse, multiculturalism\u2019s elite proponents have become ever more suppressive of traditional ethnonationalism\u2014declaring it \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d if favored by whites\u2014even as they openly stoke nonwhites\u2019 racial\/ethnic grievances to build their political factions.<\/p>\n<p>So black American nationalism is really only one of a thousand notions rendered unacceptable by America\u2019s multiculturalist cult\u2014whose mindset has managed to colonize both of the major political factions, and has successfully compensated for its evidentiary shortcomings with an hysterical, Inquisitionist crushing of dissent.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, black American nationalism does have advantages that make it a more practical aim amid this woke, antinationalist Inquisition. For one thing, it\u2019s about what American blacks want, and if they declare they want to live apart and self-governing, the elites have no good alternative to the granting of that wish. Again and again those elites have declared American blacks holy and inviolable. Even if the elites\u2019 motive in saying so has been only political and expedient, many blacks, and liberal whites, have taken the assertion at face value.<\/p>\n<p>Another practical advantage that should make black nationalism more viable as a white cause is that American whites, I guess for reasons relating to their Christian backgrounds, prefer to think of themselves as helping others, not as acting selfishly for their own benefit. What could be more unselfish than to carve out thousands of square miles from their fair land, and donate it to their black brothers and sisters, to give them a new and truer freedom?<\/p>\n<p>Would the blacks who lived in such a country experience a decline in living standards? I expect that they would, at least initially and in material terms. But as na\u00efve as it may seem for me to say so, the issue here really goes deeper than material considerations: It\u2019s about self-determination and human dignity. There are about fifty million black descendants of slaves living in the United States, enough to form one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, and in many ways they have made clear that they are a distinctive people who prefer their own kind to others. The claim that they must nevertheless be the permanent captives and pawns of one political faction or another, in a society of European origin that is majority nonblack\u2014a society that also jails them at sky-high rates\u2014is actually ludicrous. It is one of the many toxic lies Americans foolishly think they can continue to live with.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who&#8217;s afraid of black nationalism?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":215,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[10,3,5,4,7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/212"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=212"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/212\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":270,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/212\/revisions\/270"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/215"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=212"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=212"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=212"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

Allen Hynek would later call a \u201cClose Encounter of the Third Kind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The case involved a series of UFO sightings\u2014by mission staff and other locals\u2014of odd lights in the sky and saucer-shaped crafts, over a period of several weeks, culminating in a close encounter in late June. The mission head, William Gill, a 31-year-old Australian named William Gill, had more or less dismissed some of the earlier sightings in a <a href=\"http:\/\/rowancallick.com\/article-for-png-post-courier\/\">letter<\/a> written June 26 to a senior colleague based elsewhere in PNG:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I am inclined to believe that probably many UFOs are more likely some form of electric phenomena\u2014or perhaps something brought about by the atom bomb explosions etc.<\/p>\n<p>Having signed himself \u201cDoubting William,\u201d Gill later that day became a UFO believer, as he explained in a follow-up letter to the same colleague on June 27:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Life is strange, isn\u2019t it? Yesterday I wrote you a letter, expressing opinions re the UFOs. Now, less than 24 hours later I have changed my views somewhat.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Last night we at Boianai experienced about 4 hours of UFO activity, and there is no doubt whatsoever that they are handled by beings of some kind. At times it was absolutely breathtaking.<\/p>\n<p>What Gill and his staff and parishioners saw (and more than three dozen later signed a statement affirming the truth of Gill\u2019s account) was a saucer-shaped craft that approached the village closely, and came as low as 100 meters from the ground. It had a deck on top, from which four different beings, human in appearance, observed the people on the ground.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">One figure seemed to be standing looking down at us (a group of about a dozen). I stretched my arm above my head and waved. To our surprise the figure did the same. Ananias waved both arms over his head then the two outside figures did the same.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Ananias and myself began waving our arms and all four now seemed to wave back. There seemed to be no doubt that our movements were answered. All mission boys made audible gasps (of either joy or surprise, perhaps both).<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">As dark was beginning to close in, I sent Eric Kodawara for a torch and directed a series of long dashes towards the UFO. After a minute or two of this, the UFO apparently acknowledged by making several wavering motions back and forth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Waving by us was repeated and this followed by more flashes of torch, then the UFO began slowly to become bigger, apparently coming in our direction. It ceased after perhaps half a minute and came no further.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">After a further two or three minutes the figures apparently lost interest in us for they disappeared \u2018below deck.\u2019 At 6.25 pm two figures re-appeared to carry on with whatever they were doing [seemingly setting up equipment on the deck] before the interruption. The blue spotlight [emitted upward at a 45-degree angle from the top of the craft] came on for a few seconds twice in succession.<\/p>\n<p>The craft was accompanied by others in the sky nearby, but none landed, and eventually the sightings\u2014often obscured by cloud cover\u2014petered out, more or less coincident with a series of mysterious, loud explosions in the sky.<\/p>\n<p>Gill later commented that the saucer-like object he had seen at close range \u201clooked a perfectly normal sort of object, an earth-made object. I realised, of course, that some people might think of this as a flying saucer, but I took it to be some kind of hovercraft the Americans or even the Australians had built. The figures inside looked <em>perfectly human<\/em>.\u201d [italics mine]<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"\u201cThey waved back!\u201d Father William B.

How could one convincingly dismiss such a close and well witnessed encounter involving a university-educated priest who was on record as being skeptical about UFOs?<\/p>\n<p>To me, though, the Boianai case is important mainly because it illustrates the <em>weakness<\/em> of the standard hypothesis about UFOs, which is that they (i.e., the ones with no ordinary explanation) are visitors from other star systems. This \u201cET hypothesis\u201d is weak for cases like Boianai because visitors from other star systems wouldn\u2019t look human, as the Boianai visitors did, and probably wouldn\u2019t use tech that so closely resembled ours. Like many other UFO cases, the Boianai case seems more consistent with the moderately less woo idea that these visitors are visitors from our own future, or at any rate from \u201cparallel-universe\u201d versions of Earth that resemble our world much more than distant planets would.<\/p>\n<p>In this view, the UFOs coming from our own near future, or from parallel universe Earths close to our own timeline, would have occupants that look very much like us, and tech that resembles ours\u2014whereas UFOs from our distant future or \u201cdistant\u201d parallel Earths would seem much more \u201calien,\u201d while remaining humanoid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*<\/p>\n<p>But let me back up. I have never been a UFO researcher or \u201centhusiast.\u201d I was once a journalist, and as such, in bygone days, I did spend a small slice of my life thinking and researching and writing about UFOs, and becoming acquainted with the lore.<\/p>\n<p>I met, among others, senior current\/former government\/contractor types who told me they thought it was all real\u2014UFOs, crash retrievals, the whole nine yards\u2014though they couldn\u2019t get access to verify anything. One or two of them wanted <em>me<\/em> to dig into it.<\/p>\n<p>I did that eventually, in a small way, with the backing of a prominent media organization (as in \u201cyes, feel free to tell them you\u2019re working on a story for us\u2014and let us know if you find anything interesting.\u201d) I spoke to former government officials and contractors (e.g., metals experts) who should have known something, if there was something to know. Whether I approached them directly or obliquely, they all genially professed ignorance about anything that would indicate the existence of a crashed-UFO exploitation program. Eventually I ran out of leads to pursue, and went back to writing about more ordinary stuff.<\/p>\n<p>I felt some relief at that. The idea of a supersecret government UFO program was unsettling. I also felt to some extent that if it existed, it probably <em>should<\/em> be kept a secret. Moreover, the whole UFO field by then had become, to me, a hall of mirrors in which fact and rumor, fact-finding and UFO evangelism, were almost impossible to tell apart. I was never comfortable there.<\/p>\n<p>I still found the UFO literature compelling, not in its entirety, of course, but in key cases involving multiple independent witnesses, some with radar backup and so on. I retained a sort of middle-of-the-road view of UFOs, reasoning that we\u2019re in a big universe, we\u2019re unlikely to be alone, and so probably some UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin.<\/p>\n<p>I also came to the conclusion, not then but eventually, that the ability of contemporary humans to learn about visitors from advanced ET civilizations is probably <a href=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/the-incomprehensible-alien\/\">very, very limited<\/a>, so that ufology (in the usual sense, aimed at ET-UFOs) is likely a mug\u2019s game, whether conducted privately or with taxpayer funds.<\/p>\n<p>Had I not walked away from UFOs, I might even have ended up being the journalist the government-connected enthusiasts used to break that big <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/16\/us\/politics\/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html\">story<\/a> in the <em>New York Times<\/em> in 2017. In any case, thanks to those enthusiasts, and to the journalist they chose, Leslie Kean\u2014above all, thanks to the late Senator <a href=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/the-incomprehensible-alien\/\">Harry Reid <\/a>who got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2021\/05\/10\/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously\">small UFO program<\/a> funded from 2008-2016 or so&#8212;UFOs in the last few years have become almost a mainstream thing again. New government programs have been set up, and the &#8220;expert&#8221; panels for these include government-employed individuals who are very enthusiastic about the subject.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe in some cases they are <em>too<\/em> enthusiastic. <a href=\"https:\/\/thedebrief.org\/intelligence-officials-say-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft\/\">One or two <\/a>of them heard a story like the one I heard, about a UFO recovery\/exploitation program, and in recent months have been trying to use their positions on these panels to act as \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d and rip the lid off the whole thing.<\/p>\n<p>Good reasons to keep it a secret, if it exists:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Harmful psychosocial effects could follow the exposure of such a program\u2014which would disrupt most of the \u201crealities\u201d and moral orders humans have constructed for themselves. Just being forced to acknowledge the existence of beings with superior technology could, on its own, have a seriously demoralizing effect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>If any of the material can be exploited technologically, then it is better for the US to do that, and to keep it secret, than to \u201cshare it with the world,\u201d including the world\u2019s bad actors such as China and Russia.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The knowledge that the US has such material, and the possibility that the US and its allies can exploit it, might be enough to dissuade some of those bad actors from doing seriously bad things, such as using nuclear weapons. (More than two decades ago, I started but never finished writing a novel, loosely based on my journalistic experiences, in which the whole \u201cUFO crash retrieval\u201d story turned out to be a psy-op against the Chinese in the run-up to their planned Taiwan invasion.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For the same reasons, I find it hard to take at face value the claims by the so-called whistleblowers (who may have been making large sums off their fame\/notoriety even before their claims are verified) that they are selflessly doing humanity a favor by forcing disclosure of this alleged secret program.<\/p>\n<p>But to return to my main point: If these claims about recovered vehicles or fragments are true (and there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblackvault.com\/casefiles\/the-ufo-files-of-mussolini-fascist-ufo-files-by-roberto-pinotti\/\">quite<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Crash-Corona-Military-Retrieval-Cover-Up\/dp\/1931044899\">a<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kecksburg_UFO_incident\">few<\/a> such cases in the UFO literature, even if none is very convincing), then they suggest, once again, that \u201calien\u201d visitations involve a surprisingly low and error-prone level of tech. Why would star-faring ET civilizations that are millions or billions of years ahead of us in development send such failure-prone craft into our skies? It just doesn\u2019t make sense.<\/p>\n<p>One of the self-described whistleblowers, David Grusch, has indicated that pilot bodies were recovered in one or more of these cases. Why flesh-and-blood pilots, for a journey across light-years? And why are the \u201caliens\u201d in UFO cases always described as humanoid bipeds?<\/p>\n<p>It also doesn\u2019t make sense that the technology left behind by these supposedly super-advanced visitors would invite the prospect of reverse-engineering by ourselves. For us to reverse-engineer a crashed saucer from a millions-of-years-ahead civilization would be like <em>Australopithecus<\/em> ape-men reverse-engineering a crashed F-35.<\/p>\n<p>Again, these crash\/recovery stories, along with Boianai and many other cases in the lore, would make much more sense (to the extent we need to take them seriously) if the visitors in question were not from other star systems, but from somewhere much \u201ccloser.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*<\/p>\n<p><em>Tourists from the future<\/em> is a catchy phrase, but isn\u2019t precisely what I am hypothesizing here.<\/p>\n<p>Classical physics, and even early (\u201cCopenhagen Interpretation\u201d) quantum physics, did not offer much hope for those wishing to develop time-travel technology. A paradox always stood in the way. For example, if you were to depart in your time machine, in Hollywood time-travel fashion, and land in your own backyard the day before, greeting yourself and your wide-eyed wife and children, then you would be changing your own past\u2014you would stop being you\u2014and that just seemed impossible. To put it another way: the traditional conception of time implied a single timeline on which the entire universe exists and unfolds, with no apparent allowance for jumps backward and forward.<\/p>\n<p>The now-dominant Relative State Formulation (a.k.a. the Many Worlds Interpretation, or MWI) of quantum theory is, in principle, more accommodating. It implies\u2014to simplify\u2014that reality comprises an infinitude of ever-branching universes or timelines. Thus, apart from other physical considerations, you <em>could<\/em> travel \u201cbackwards in time,\u201d though the timeline on which you alighted would be distinct (possibly differentiating at the moment you arrive) from your timeline of origin. This means that if you traveled a day backward in time, the people you met in that \u201cdestination timeline,\u201d including your \u201cself,\u201d would be merely different versions of those populating your departure timeline. You\u2019d be in a \u201cparallel universe\u201d version of the universe you\u2019d left, and nothing you did there would alter your original timeline\u2014your personal \u201cpast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In principle, if you could jump from one timeline to another, you also could jump to more distant, parallel timelines to visit more different versions of Earth, whether in the present, past, or future. In this sense, you would be traveling not just along the dimension of time, but across it&#8212;across timelines, or &#8220;across the multiverse.&#8221; I\u2019m not sure what this kind of travel should be called. Perhaps \u201ctrans-timeline travel\u201d or \u201cframe shifting\u201d or something like that.<\/p>\n<p>How you would jump between timelines\u2014or travel back along your own and alight somewhere, forcing the branching-off of a new timeline\u2014is of course the hard problem here. Possibly there would be a conservation-of-energy issue, so that major amounts of energy would have to be released or subtracted with each jump. The explosions reported at Boianai, and in other cases, call that issue to mind (although a straight conservation-of-energy calculation implies at least gigaton yields). Though it seems that most reported UFOs depart by moving rapidly upward into the sky, it is conceivable\u2014this is all extremely speculative anyway\u2014that any necessary energy exchanges take place high in the atmosphere where they are less noticeable, and might even be taken for bolide explosions when they involve energy release.<\/p>\n<p>Why would &#8220;trans-timeline-travelers&#8221; use flying machines, instead of just materializing on the ground, as in time-travel movies? Perhaps because \u201carriving\u201d at coordinates corresponding to solid matter, inside a mountain for example, would spell instant death for the travelers\u2014and thus a high-atmosphere or outer-space entry, in suitably equipped craft, would be a standard safety measure.<\/p>\n<p>The general idea that some UFOs may be time-travel vehicles, not ET vehicles, has been <a href=\"https:\/\/futurism.com\/the-byte\/astronaut-ufos-time-travelers\">suggested in various forms<\/a> over the years. There is also a somewhat more vague idea, put forward by Jacques Vallee many decades ago, that UFOs may represent non-human visitors from other dimensions but not other star systems. Replace dimensions with \u201ctimelines\u201d (or \u201cuniverses,\u201d per MWI) and you arrive at something similar to what I am suggesting. Anyhow, again, this is all highly speculative&#8212;and it is very possible that the UFO-crash-retrieval\/exploitation story will soon be debunked and discredited. But even if that happens, the wider UFO phenomenon, with solid cases like Boianai, retains its potential to blow our minds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The &#8220;trans-timeline-traveler&#8221; hypothesis for UFOs<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":807,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[24,19,14,15,28,27,7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/805"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=805"}],"version-history":[{"count":19,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/805\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":825,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/805\/revisions\/825"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/807"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=805"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=805"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=805"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

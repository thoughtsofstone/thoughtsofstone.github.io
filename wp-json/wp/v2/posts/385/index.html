She claims that\u2014more than two decades ago, when she was just 17\u2014she slept with the British royal Prince Andrew, and suffered so much harm thereby that she is now entitled to significant monetary damages. According to the complaint filed by her lawyers:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Prince Andrew committed sexual assault and battery upon Plaintiff when she was 17 years old. As such, Prince Andrew is responsible for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law. The damage to Plaintiff has been severe and lasting . . . .<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The below photograph depicts Prince Andrew, Plaintiff, and Maxwell at Maxwell\u2019s home prior to Prince Andrew sexually abusing Plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-388 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/giuff-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"473\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/giuff-Copy.jpg 930w, https:\/\/www.thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/giuff-Copy-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/giuff-Copy-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 85vw, 473px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The reader is free to peruse the full complaint [<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courthousenews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Prince-Phillip-sexual-assault-lawsuit.pdf\">pdf<\/a>], to follow the case as it progresses, and to make judgments accordingly. I offer here, as a mere bystander who knows none of the parties, only my own humble, hushed opinions.<\/p>\n<p>Which is to say, I think it\u2019s a shameless fraud that demonstrates the shambles of the American legal system under the pressures of wokeist <a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.github.io\/the-great-feminization\/\">feminization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Worse, I think it puts on full display America&#8217;s cultural corruption&#8212;for no media commentator of prominence, as far as I know, has offered even mild skepticism about this outrageous case or others like it.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, while I believe that the stink of this business is more or less universally apparent, the average media person pretends otherwise because the stories generate clicks, and also for fear of cancellation\u2014cancellation by the same hysteria-prone demographic that got people hanged at Salem and other innocents <a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.github.io\/girl-power\/\">burned at the stake<\/a> throughout Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Let me clarify that Giuffre\u2019s case against Andrew doesn\u2019t\u2014I mean, logically shouldn\u2019t\u2014have a close connection to the legal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. I happen to think the latter were both obviously guilty of sex trafficking and related offenses, even if the sentence Epstein would have received in New York and the one Maxwell is now set to receive will be excessive (on the Great White Defendant principle) compared to typical trafficking cases, i.e., involving some Nigerian or Honduran who really does enslave and brutalize his victims. But no one has ever presented evidence that Andrew was a party to Epstein\u2019s trafficking scheme, or that he was anything other than a gentle fool who, like other fools (Bill Gates and Bill Clinton among them) hung out with his friend Epstein from time to time. (How Epstein generated the charisma to gather such people in his orbit is to me a significant mystery, albeit not relevant here.)<\/p>\n<p>Giuffre&#8217;s case rests on the simple allegation that Andrew, in cahoots with Epstein and Maxwell, somehow \u201cforced\u201d Giuffre to sleep with him&#8212;which seems not just an unsupported allegation but a preposterous one. Assuming Giuffre and Andrew even did have sex, we have been given no reason to picture it as any less volitional on her part than her demeanor in the photograph would suggest. And I think it&#8217;s safe to say that Andrew, whatever his other failings, has never shown a propensity for treating women in the manner alleged.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, it appears that Giuffre, having partied and traveled widely and gotten to know various men, all on Epstein\u2019s nickel, has been, since E&#8217;s legal troubles began, squeezing him or his estate (also Ghislaine Maxwell and Alan Dershowitz) for further money; and the suit against Andrew represents one of the continuations of that broader effort; all of which speaks clearly to the issue of her motive.<\/p>\n<p>In short, the case has the <em>prima facie<\/em> appearance of being no more than a shakedown: an attempt essentially to extort money with the threat of an embarrassing civil trial if the money is not paid.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this, there is a good chance Giuffre will prevail&#8212;her blue-chip lawyers, who probably stand to get around a third of any award or settlement, would not have taken the case otherwise. Most likely she will prevail because Andrew and his family will decide to settle rather than endure the pain of a trial. Even if they are willing to endure that pain, the corruption the <em>#MeToo<\/em> strain of wokeness has caused in the American legal system, including juries, makes any such case a roll of the dice, at least. The judge in the case also may not be an even-handed Myron Kovitsky type (<em>Bonfire of the Vanities<\/em>); he is Lewis Kaplan, a Clinton appointee and a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lewis_A._Kaplan\">paid-up member of the New York liberal elite<\/a>, whose demeanor in an <a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2022\/01\/04\/judge-appears-to-let-prince-andrew-sex-abuse-suit-move-forward\/\">early hearing<\/a> does not bode well for the prince.<\/p>\n<p>Shakedowns occur all the time, among highlifes and lowlifes, but this one is so prominent, so front-and-center, and yet apparently so untouchable by simple reason and skepticism. No disinterested observer can question it! Everybody <em>loves<\/em> Empress Virginia\u2019s new clothes! Little wonder that Dershowitz, target of another one of Giuffre\u2019s suits, has come across as almost apoplectic when talking about her to reporters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">certified, complete, total liar [<a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/07\/01\/epstein-sex-slave-giuffre-dershowitz-lose-in-court-ruling\/\">link<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I\u2019m not neutral on this, because [Giuffre] also accused me of having sex with her, and I proved conclusively \u2014 through her own diaries, through her own lawyer, through our own emails \u2014 that it would be impossible for me to have ever met her. [<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/radio\/2021\/12\/21\/alan-dershowitz-prosecution-hid-main-witness-at-ghislaine-maxwell-trial\/\">link<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope my writing this emboldens some of you out there to speak up\u2014quixotically, I know, but so be it\u2014and state what is obvious about cases like this, namely that they need to be strongly discouraged somehow, and the men targeted by them need to be better protected. The US and other Western legal systems already make many concessions to women, including protection from incidental reputational harm in rape cases. Why can&#8217;t men receive a similar level of protection from the <em>deliberate<\/em> reputational harm of shakedown cases?<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course, you know why\u2014because women essentially are now in charge, and are <a href=\"https:\/\/americanmind.org\/salvo\/pink-shift\/\">remodeling the institutions of Western life to suit themselves<\/a>. With essentially zero pushback from men. I begin to tire of pointing this out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Giuffre v.

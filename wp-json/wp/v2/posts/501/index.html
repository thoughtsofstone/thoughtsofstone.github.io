It is a public reaction to an outrage that rises explosively above the usual outrages, involves fellow Westerners, and is available to tug at the heartstrings 24\/7 on a variety of electronic media.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it really does look like a broad translation of the usual domestic cancellation strategies to the geopolitical scene, including economic punishment, censorship, general ostracism, threats of judicial action, and indirect assistance for those who fight the Cancelled One, but of course no direct, overt involvement in that fighting.<\/p>\n<p>Given the scale of this response, the scale of the atrocity that triggered it, and the scale of Russia\u2019s ongoing losses in Ukraine, Putin\u2019s downfall seems inevitable. After killing many thousands of innocent Ukrainians, destroying probably trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of Ukrainian buildings and other infrastructure, utterly breaking Russia&#8217;s army and air force, and of course lying through his teeth about his actions and motives, he does not appear to have any way out\u2014any peaceful \u201coff ramp.\u201d He is our generation\u2019s Hitler, and I suspect he already knows that his days, in office at least, are numbered.<\/p>\n<p>There are many potential pluses to a Putin downfall. One is that Russia again will have a chance to achieve what it could not achieve in the 1990s, namely a more mature form of government and economy, oriented towards and not against the West. Such a transformation of Russia, which I think is somewhat more likely than the alternative, would mean a final unification of all the West\u2019s major powers, and at least a temporary \u201cemboldening\u201d of them. That in turn could usher in one of those periods of history, like 1990-2010, in which the West reigns supreme over all earthly comers. In this scenario, bad actors such as Iran, China, and North Korea would have to watch their step, at the very least, and the world in that sense would be a safer place.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the bad news. Even if the \u201cbest case\u201d scenario happens\u2014including a glorious Russian uprising and overthrow of the dictator, maybe even on Easter Sunday (April 24 in the Russian Orthodox calendar)\u2014the West has suffered a blow in its own ranks that I think is of dire significance.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve read any of my previous essays on this site, you know that I have taken a generally dim view of the West\u2019s future. Cultural\/political feminization; mass immigration, multiculturalism and wokeism; and the lack of political tools for solving these problems, have doomed the West in the most basic ways, as I have seen it. On the other hand, conservatives in the West have been gaining strength and coherence in recent years in reaction to the excesses of Letfism\/wokeism. As recently as a month ago, it had seemed plausible to me that a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%C3%89ric_Zemmour\">Zemmour<\/a>-ization of the Western Right (Eric Zemmour is explicitly against both cultural feminization and mass-immigration\/heavy-multiculturalism) could, eventually and with a lot of luck, restore the situation.<\/p>\n<p>But what Putin\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine revealed all too clearly is that much of the Right in the West is, well, <em>wrong<\/em>, and about fundamental things. Sadly, these Wrong Rightists include Zemmour as well as prominent commentators in the US, Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance among them.<\/p>\n<p>The Wrong Rightists hate, first and foremost, what they call the Globalist American Empire (GAE). Fair enough\u2014I hate it too. The problem is that they view Putin not as a murderous kleptocrat and global troublemaker (as I view him), but rather as a valuable counterweight to the hegemony of the GAE\u2014a counterweight they want to <em>strengthen<\/em>, not weaken. These pro-Putin rightists have seemed quite willing to nullify the sovereignty of Ukraine (and, since the invasion started, have been willing to let Putin&#8217;s murders of tens of thousands of Ukrainians go unpunished), in order to preserve this counterweight\u2014this bastion of old-fashioned Christian values according to the peculiar delusion afflicting some of them.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, quite a few of the Wrong Rightists are backpedaling now, saying they deplore what Putin did, etc. They understand, at least at some level, the parallels between their sentiments and the discredited sentiments of say, Laval in France and Lindbergh in the USA during 1939-41. They therefore tend to exhibit their distress over the impending collapse of Russia as a Great Power, and the impending destruction of Putin and Putinism, in ways that are more or less indirect. They are peevish about Ukrainian \u201cpropaganda.\u201d They lament the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to have prevented the horrors of this war by barring Ukraine from NATO, thereby calming the nerves of their sensitive hero in the Kremlin. They speak darkly of Ukrainian \u201cNazis.\u201d They yearn for a swift settlement that preserves Putin in power (and, not incidentally, conceals the fatuity of everything they have claimed or predicted about all this). They emit copious cope about how Russia is still destined to \u201cwin.\u201d Above all, they say the West should care less about Ukraine and more about problems at home.<\/p>\n<p>Here are just a few examples of this output (to which I may add soon as time permits):<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-524 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tc-clientstate.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"536\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tc-clientstate.jpg 596w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tc-clientstate-300x221.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 85vw, 536px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-469 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/tucker1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"527\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/tucker1.jpg 527w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/tucker1-300x235.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 85vw, 527px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-507 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vance1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"491\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vance1.jpg 689w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vance1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vance1-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 85vw, 491px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-508 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/trumponputin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/trumponputin.jpg 506w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/trumponputin-257x300.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 85vw, 506px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-509 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/gabbard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"524\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/gabbard.jpg 524w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/gabbard-300x80.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 85vw, 524px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-517 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/coulter1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"511\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/coulter1.jpg 608w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/coulter1-300x118.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 511px) 85vw, 511px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-525 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/hanania-thingspplwillbelieve.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/hanania-thingspplwillbelieve.jpg 614w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/hanania-thingspplwillbelieve-300x90.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-526 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/hanania-emotion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/hanania-emotion.jpg 592w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/hanania-emotion-300x93.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 85vw, 592px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-528 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mcconnell-vietcong.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mcconnell-vietcong.jpg 616w, https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mcconnell-vietcong-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 85vw, 556px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What I think all this means is that the Western Right in general now is left with much less credibility in the eyes of the average normie citizen, just as occurred in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. In particular, the pro-Putin, &#8220;America First&#8221; sector of the Right, the sector that happens also to be most deeply concerned with the most serious issues, such as mass immigration, has grandly shot itself through the foot\u2014or maybe through the heart. This has left the Left\/center-Right \u201cGAE\u201d coalition in a much better position, so that there won\u2019t be a Zemmour-type president in the USA any time soon\u2014and I\u2019m guessing now there won\u2019t be one even in France. Thus the West\u2019s demise will have been hastened at the very moment of its own apparent triumph over its longtime mortal enemy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Right&#8217;s &#8220;sympathy for the devil&#8221; has weakened it at a crucial moment<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":502,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5,6,13,17,16,7,11,2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/501"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=501"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/501\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":529,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/501\/revisions\/529"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/502"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=501"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=501"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thoughtsofstone.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=501"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
